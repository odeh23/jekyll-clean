title: "Document Conversion Assignment"
---
The written work that I integrated into this repository are the first for lines from an original poem that I wrote and performed for EROT's Valentine's Day Show. This piece as a whole just details the escapades of a summer fling.

My scripts works such that I was able to convert marked-up document source files into multiple outpute layouts. Furthermore I utilized Pandoc to convert my written file into markdown from the original template. Also, I wrote a bash script to convert my text files that were originally in markdown format into DOCX, HTML, and PDF. In the linked repository, the title of the file is "Spitbars", however, the written work comes from my orginal poem, entitled "Just Another Interluuube".
