Hello.

My name is Daniel Odeh. I am a rising senior and I am from Durham, NC. I currently am double majoring in AAAD and Communications, while also minoring in music. I took this class because I thought that it would be both interesting and useful to learn how to code and familiar myself with information and library science. It is my hope that by the end of this summer session, I'll be familiar with Github and Codeanywhere, while also building skills for my resume. Furthermore, it is my hope to see how coding and information library science could help me to build a music career.
