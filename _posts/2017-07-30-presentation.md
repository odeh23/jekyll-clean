title: "Forbidden Knowledge Final Presentation"
---

For my final presentation, I decided to create a slideshow for one of my favorite rap verses. The verse in question is the second verse from the song "Forbidden Knowledge" by Raury, an alternative, indie, folk, emcee. This song also contains a feature from the southern powerhouse emcee, Big K.R.I.T. The selected verse is 16 bars long. With this being said, I committed one bar to each slide, with the theme of each bar as the header of each slide. Additionally, I committed images to each slide that I found to be cool and symbolic of that respective bar's meaning.
